# TITLE: SSM.1 EC2 instances should be managed by AWS Systems Manager
# DESCRIPTION: This policy ensures that EC2 instances are managed by AWS Systems Manager.

		# check if the IAM instance profile has one of the SSM managed policies attached.
		# However, this would require additional logic to trace the IAM role and its policies.
		# For this policy, we're assuming that having an IAM instance profile is sufficient.
		# A more comprehensive check would involve examining the actual policies attached to the role.
